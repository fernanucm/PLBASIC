# PLBASIC
Interpreter and debugger of BASIC programs implemented in Prolog


## Credits
The interpreter follows the (great) implementation and some guidelines of [`victorlagerkvist`](https://prologomenon.wordpress.com/2020/10/25/writing-a-basic-interpreter-part-1/) [[1]](#ref1).
Any bug and bad design decisions in PLBASIC must be blamed on me. 

Some example programs have been adapted from [8bitworkshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/).


## 1. Introduction

This repository includes a text-based interface for both an interpreter and debugger of BASIC programs, implemented in SWI-Prolog.
Being multiplatform, it can be used directly from sources (folder `./src`) having installed SWI-Prolog 8.x or above. 
However, this project has been tested on Windows 10 and some differences may exist with respect to other OS's.

This project was motivated to emulate the Microsoft BASIC implementation in the Seiko UC 2000 watch from the 80's, coupled with the Seiko UC 2200 for writing (and printing) programs.
The manuals can be found at [[3]](#ref3).

Thus, the screen is originally set to a small size of 5 lines and 10 columns, but can be enlarged (or even shortened!) to other sizes (see the `flags.pl` file in the `./src` folder).

The intention of the project is to be neither complete nor accurate, but a raw approximation to the real thing.
Some features are not present while others are added.


### 1.1 Requirements

PLBASIC requires SWI-Prolog 8.x or higher already installed. In addition, the pack EDCG must be installed in SWI-Prolog. For example:

```prolog

### 1.2. Caveats

* More contents will be uploaded as time permits.
* `TODO` indicates tasks to be done (in the expected near future).


## 2. A First Glance

### 2.1. Starting the BASIC Interpreter from SWI-Prolog

Start SWI-Prolog from the `./src` folder with either `pl` in Linuxes or `swipl-win.exe` in Windows, setting the behavior of double_quotes to codes.
(Though the `swipl.exe` executable is also available, required ANSI codes are not fully supported and thus it cannot be used to run PLBASIC.) 
For example, open a `cmd` terminal in Windows and change the directory to the folder where PLBASIC is located (e.g., with `cd c:\plbasic`) and type:

```bat
C:\PLBASIC> swipl-win.exe -g "set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, codes)"
```

From Linux (yet to be tested):

```bat
$ swipl -g "set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, codes)"
```

Then, assuming that you started SWI-Prolog from the folder where PLBASIC is located, write the following at the SWI-Prolog prompt:

```prolog
?- [basic].
?- run("10 print ""Hello!""").
```

This results in:

```
+- SCREEN -+
|Hello!    |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
+lc(1,0)---+
```

Here, `SCREEN` is the panel surrounding the watch screen. Below, the numbers in the term `lc(1,0)` show the current line an column (both 0-based) of the cursor. In this case, the cursor is finally placed at the second line (number 1) and first column (number 0) because the `print` command moves the cursor to the next line.

Instead of passing the program as shown, a file can be selected otherwise, such as in:

```prolog
?- run('./bas/factorial.bas').
```

(notice the single quotes `'` delimiting the file path as opposed to double quotes `"`) which displays:

```
+- SCREEN -+
| 120      |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
+lc(1,0)---+
```

i.e., the result of computing the factorial of 5.


### 2.2. Starting the BASIC Debugger from SWI-Prolog

While the interpreter is a simple way to executing BASIC programs, the debugger (not present in the original Seiko watch) includes expected features of a simple debugger: step-by-step, breakpoints, inspects and the like.

From the SWI-Prolog program prompt, write the following to consult and start the debugger for a given program (`reverse.bas` as an example):

```prolog
?- [debug].
?- debug('./bas/ball.bas').
```

This leads to the debugger user interface, which consists of several panels:

* `PROGRAM`. The loaded program, if any.
* `SCREEN`. The same as in the interpreter.
* `CONTROL`. Available commands, executed by pressing the letter between brackets or the special keys.
* `INSPECT`. List of variables found along executing the program, displaying their values.
* `FILES`. A basic file explorer to open BASIC programs.

An example of the debuggger display is:

```
--->

This snapshot corresponds to executing the example program `ball.bas` (bouncing ball) with the command `RUN`, by pressing the key `r` . The arrangement of these panels can be changed by moving and resizing them at will. When the command `MOVE` or `RESIZE` has been enabled by pressing the keys `m` and `z` respectively, arrow keys can be used to move and resize the selected panel. To select another panel, you press `TAB` and the panel heading is shown highlighted.

#### Debugger Commands

The `CONTROL` panel lists the available commands and their keyboard shorcuts between parentheses. 
These commands are the following:

* `RUN`:       Execute the program up to its end, `stop` instruction or first breakpoint
* `STEP`:      Execute the current statement (which is shown highlighted)
* `% STOP`:    Stop the execution (`TODO`. Requires external DLL to be built)
* `CONT`:      Continue the execution
* `SETBK`:     Set breakpoint at the top line in the PROGRAM panel
* `RESET`:     Reset the debugging session (reload the program)
* `RENUM`:     Renum the program and reset
* `OPEN`:      Open a file from a selectable folder
* `SAVE`:      Save the loaded program (useful after a renumbering)
* `QUIT`:      Quit the debugger
* `REFRESH`:   Clear the host screen and redraw
* `TAB`:       Move focus to the next panel
* `RESIZE`:    Let the panel in focus to be resized with the arrow keys
* `MOVE`:      Let the panel in focus to be moved with the arrow keys
* `ArrowUp`:   Scroll up/Vertical Downsize/Move Up the panel in focus
* `ArrowDown`: Scroll down/Vertical Upsize/Move Down the panel in focus
* `ArrowLeft`: Horizontal Downsize/Move Left the panel in focus
* `ArrowRight`: Horizontal Upsize/Move Right the panel in focus
* `PageUp`:    Page up the panel in focus
* `PageDown`:  Page down the panel in focus
* `Home`:      Go to the first line of the panel in focus
* `End`:       Go to the last line of the panel in focus

##### Implementation note: 

Since the `PageUp` and `PageDown` keys do not return an ASCII code that can be read with `get_single_char/1` (in Windows), other keys have been selected as shortcuts (`u` and `d`, respectively).
As well, the `STOP` command requires reading the keyboard without waiting for a key press, which can be better implemented with a new foreign predicate written in C/C++ (expected to be completed in the near future). However, this is not required for Linux because there exists a non-blocking read of key presses.

#### Commands of the `FILES` panel

This panel is opened with the debugger command `OPEN`, leading to something like this:

<img src="https://github.com/fernanucm/PLBASIC/blob/main/images/Files.jpg" alt= "The PLBASIC Debugger" width="120px">

<!---
```
+--- FILES ---+
|./bas        |
|<..>         |
|ball.bas     |
|factorial.bas|
|lander.bas   |
|matches.bas  |
|reverse.bas  |
|             |
+-------------+
```
--->

The first row in the panel below the title bar is the current folder.
The highlighted row is the selected row for either opening the file or navigating into the folder.
Folders are enclosed between angle brackets, and pressing `Intro` when `<..>` is selected means to go up in the folder tree. 

The following commands are available for this panel:

* `ArrowUp`:   Scroll up the panel
* `ArrowDown`: Scroll down the panel
* `ESCAPE`:    Cancel the `OPEN` command
* `INTRO`:     Select the file to open / Navigate to the folder


#### Breakpoints

You can toggle a breakpoint in the first row of the `PROGRAM` panel by hitting the `b` key.
The breakpoint is displayed as an asterisk (`*`) between the statement number and the BASIC instruction.
As long as a line can contain multiple statements, each one is split in different rows in the program listing, with the format `line number:statement number`.
Thus, a breakpoint can be set in any statement of a given line, and many breakpoints can be set in a single program.

For example, given the next call:

```prolog
?- debug("10 for i=0 to 9 : print i; : next i").
```

A breakpoint can be set at the second statement (`02`) of the first line (`00010`), as displayed next:

```
+-------- PROGRAM ---------+              
|00010:01 FOR I = 0 TO 9   |              
|00010:02*PRINT I;         | 
|00010:03 NEXT I           |
|                          |
+--------------------------+     
```

To set that breakpoint, first the down arrow has been pressed before setting on the breakpoint with the key `b` (then, the arrow up has been pressed to list all the program).
Note that both variables and instructions are case-insensitive.
The system can be configured to list programs in either upcase or downcase letters (see next section Configuration).


#### Configuration
File `flags.pl` contains configurations for different elements:


##### Initial locations and sizes of panels

Screen:
```prolog
screen_panel_location(lc(0, 43)).
screen_panel_size(rc(5, 10)).
```

Program:

```prolog
program_panel_location(lc(0, 0)).
program_panel_size(rc(10, 40)).
```

Inspect:
```prolog
inspect_panel_location(lc(25, 0)).
inspect_panel_size(rc(10, 40)).
```

Control:
```prolog
control_panel_location(lc(13, 0)).
control_panel_size(rc(10, 27)).
```


##### Listings

* Uppercase/Downcase.
```prolog
uppercase(on). % Default is uppercase ('on'). Change to lowercase with 'off'
```

* Extra blanks to improve reading.

```prolog
optional_spaces(on). % Change to 'off' to remove optional spaces
```

* `LET` instruction.
```prolog
let(off). % Change to 'on' if you prefer LET to appear in listings
```


##### Colors

In Windows, SWI-Prolog supports color themes in the `swipl-win.exe` console.

* Interface colors: Themes

  SWI-Prolog allows to load color themes as defined in Prolog files.
  This project includes a couple of themes in the folder `./src/themes`.
  For example, to select white letters over a blue background (as some old 8 bit computers enjoyed):

  ```prolog
  ?- use_module('themes/blue_white.pl').
  ```
This is what `basic.pl` contains as a directive, so that upon consulting it, this theme is applied by default.

  You can change or add new themes at will in these themes.

* Coloring elements

  File `color.pl` contains color definitions for different elements (focused panels, panel headings and highlighted lines).
  Available color names are listed in the predicate `color/3`, and resumed next:
  
  `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`, `bright_black`, `bright_red`, `bright_green`, `bright_yellow`, `bright_blue`, `bright_magenta`, `bright_cyan`, `bright_white`
  
    * Focused panel (title bar)
   
    ```prolog
    text_color(focused, fb(bright_blue, white)).
    ```

    * Panel headings (such as the current path in the `FILE` panel)
   
    ```prolog
    text_color(heading, fb(bright_white, bright_black)).
    ```
    
    * Highlighted line (in the `PROGRAM` panel)
   
    ```prolog
    text_color(highlighted, fb(bright_blue, white)).
    ```
    
* Keywords. It should not be difficult to add syntax highlighting (`TODO`)

## Supported Instruction Set

While the online manual [[2]](#ref2) of Guillaume Tello (2008) was consulted in the first term, a recent scan for the original manual can be found at [[3]](#ref3). Following this, the next instructions, functions and operators below are supported:

### Instructions

* `RUN [li]`
  Runs the program (starting at line `li` is provided).
  
* `LIST [li]`
  Displays the listing of the program using the line number order. With `li` specified, starts from this line til the end.

* `NEW`
  Erases the whole program and variables from memory.
  
* `CLEAR`
  Erases all variables values and definitions (those declared with `DIM`). The program remains in memory.
  
* `CONT`
  If a program is stopped with `STOP` (instruction or key), execution can be resumed (`TODO`: Not useful until interactive commands are supported).

* `DIM var(n1 [,n2,..,max])`
  Declares `var` as an array, it seems that `max`=5.
  
* `[LET] var=expression`
  Computes the expression and stores it into `var`. `LET` is optional.
  
* `DEF FNvar(x)=..expression of x..`
  Declares `FNvar` as a function, then to use it, as a numeric value, just write `FNvar(x)`.

* `CLS`
  Clears the screen and the cursor goes to the upper left.
  
* `BEEP`
  Outputs a beep sound.

* `REM text`
  Inserts a remark in the program. 
  
* `FOR var=x TO x’ [STEP x’’]`
	`instructions`
  `NEXT var`
  Initialises `var` to `x` and repeats the instruction block until `var>x’`.
	If no `STEP` is specified, then `STEP=1` is assumed to increment `var` at each iteration.
	If `x’’<0`, then loop until `var<x’`.

* `GOTO li`
  Jumps to the specified line.

* `ON n GOTO li1 [, li2…., limax]`
  Computes the integer value of `n`, and, if `n=1` jumps to `li1`, if `n=2` to li2, etc.
	if `n<1` or `n>max` then no jump is performed and go to the next instruction.

* `IF condition THEN [instructions|li]`
  If a condition is true (different from zero) then the following instructions are executed, or jump to the specified line number `li`. If the condition is false (equal to zero) then execution goes on to the next line.

* `PRINT [ str or x[, or ; [etc…]] ]`
  If separated by `;` they are displayed next to the previous `;` if separated by `,` an 8-width tabulator is applied between values. Each numeric value is preceded by a space if positive or by a `-` if negative.
  
* `INPUT [«message» ;]var1[,var2,… ]`
  Display the message, if present, and ask for the values of each variable.
  
* `DATA value1[,value2,...]`
  Inserts a list of immediate values (reals or strings, but not expressions) in the program. 

* `READ var1 [,var2,…]`
  Reads values in `DATA` statements into each variable (as an `INPUT` but without a human intervention).

* `RESTORE [li]`
  Tells from which `DATA` line the next `READ` should pick its values.
  
* `STOP`
  Stops the execution.
  
* `CONT`
  Resumes a stopped execution.
  
* `END`
  Stops the program. Cannot be resumed.

### Functions

* `FRE(x)`
	Returns the number of free bytes, 2922 at start. The argument `x` is ignored.
        This function, though present, is not emulated, always returning that number.

* `RND(x)`
	Returns a pseudo-random number in the range [0;1[.
	* If `x>0`, returns the next random number.
	* If `x=0`, returns the last random number.
	* If `x<0`, initilalizes a new serie of random numbers according to `x`.

* `SQR(x)`
	Returns the square root of the positive value `x`.

* `INT(x)`
	Returns the highest integer lower or equal to `x`.

* `ABS(x)`
	Returns the absolute value of `x`.

* `SGN(x)`
	Returns the sign of `x` in this way:
	* if `x>0` then `SGN(x)=1`
	* if `x<0` then `SGN(x)=-1`
	* if `x=0` then `SGN(x)=0`

* `COS(x)`
Returns the cosine of the `x` argument.	The angle is in radians.

* `SIN(x)`
Returns sine of the `x` argument.	The angle is in radians.

* `TAN(x)`
Returns the tangent of the `x` argument. The angle is in radians.

* `ATN(x)`
	Returns the reverse tangent of the `x` argument. The angle is in radians.

* `EXP(x)`
	Returns the exponential of `x` (base is e=2.71828…).

* `LOG(x)`
	Returns the natural logarithm of `x` (base is e=2.71828…).

* `INKEY$` `TODO` (Requires the external predicate to be built)
	Returns the current key pressed, else a null string.

* `ASC(str)`
  Returns the ASCII code of the first character of the string `str`.
  
* `CHR$(x)`
	Returns a one character string corresponding to the `x` ASCII code.

* `VAL(str)`
  Returns a real described in the string `str`.

* `STR$(x)`
	Returns the string descibing the real `x`.

* `LEN(str)`
	Returns the length of `str`.

* `LEFT$(str,n)`
	Returns a string with the `n` leftmost characters of `str`.

* `RIGHT$(str,n)`
	Returns a string with the n rightmost characters of `str`.

* `MID$(str,n1,n2)`
	Returns a string with `n2` characters long starting at position `n1` in `str`.

* `TAB(n)`
  Specifies how many spaces before next printing. It is used as part of `PRINT`.
  
* `POS(0)`
	Pseudo-variable that returns the current cursor column from 0 to 9.

* `CSRLIN`
	Pseudo variable that returns the current cursor line from 0 to 3.

* `LOCATE n1,n2`
	Places the cursor at the given location:
	`n1` is the column from 0 to 9
	`n2` is the line from 0 to 3.

### Operators

* Arithmetic operators: `+` `-` `*` `/` `^`

* Logical operators: `=` `>` `<` `>=` `>=` `<>` `AND` `OR` `NOT`

Parentheses can be used as needed to surround expressions.

### Additional supported features

* `IF condition THEN [instructions|li] ELSE [instructions|li]`

* Fractional numbers.

* Values in `READ` can be expressions.

* `PAUSE time`
  Time in seconds to pause execution.


### Unsupported features

* Interactive commands at the screen.

* In the original system, the `;` separator could be omitted between an immediate string and a value. For example: `PRINT "X=";X;"Km"` can be compacted as `PRINT “X=”X”Km”`. In this implementation, this is not allowed.

* `EDIT [li]`
  Edition of line `li`.
  
* `LLIST [li]`
  Same as `LIST` but printed on paper instead of displayed on screen.

* `MLIST [li]`
  Same as `LIST` but with output to the memorandum memory.

* `LPRINT [str or x[, or ; [etc…]]]`
  The same as `PRINT` but for the printer.

* `MPRINT [str or x[, or ; [etc…]]]`
  The same as `PRINT` but with output to the memorandum memory.

* Original error messages (`TODO`).
  Currently, lexical, syntactic and run-time error messages are raised, but they do not match the original ones.


## 3. Implementation

### 3.1. The Interpreter

As already said at the beginning, the interpreter is based on the (great) implementation and some guidelines of [`victorlagerkvist`](https://prologomenon.wordpress.com/2020/10/25/writing-a-basic-interpreter-part-1/) [[1]](#ref1).
The reader is advised to first read his blog before continuing this.
Its code is located at [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Joelbyte/a62ad46e2941dc1006cc153b2b63c1ec) [[2]](#ref2)).

Basically, [[1]](#ref1) defines a `comp` object as a SWI-Prolog dict data structure holding several named arguments: program (`program`), memory (`mem`), instruction counter (`line`), stack (`stack`), and status (`status`).
Here, some other arguments have been added (`source`, `screen`, `cursor`, `runline`, and `data`), which will be commented along this section.

#### PLBASIC improvements with respect to Prolog BASIC 0.1

* Module system.
* Lexer. Implemented with EDCG with two purposes: hide both the list of codes, and the line and column numbers used for error reporting.
* Parser. Implemented with DCG (there is no need for hiding more accumulators). 
* Error reporting in parsing and running programs. The new named argument `runline` for the `comp` object has been added to report the line for the statement being executed.
* Resizeable screen. With a default screen 10 column wide and 4 line height, this tiny dimensions can be enlarged to better display results and listings. The screen is implemented as an additional named argument `screen` in the dict for the `comp` object. Also, the named argument `cursor` has been added to hold the current line and column where the cursor is located, as a term `lc(Line, Column)`.
* Multiple sentences in a line separated by colons. This requires a new line numbering: `LineNumber-StatementNumber`. In particular, several statements are allowed in `IF` statements.
* `ELSE` statements. However, this is unsupported in Seiko Data 2000.
* Evaluation of Boolean and string expressions.
* Floats (`float`/3) and fractionals (`frac`/2) are identified, though both are treated as floats.
* Expressions in `GOTO` statements.
* Logical operators `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.
* `GOTO` and `GOSUB` to a non-existent line number `L`. As in [[3]](#ref3), a jump like this ends in the next line to `L`.
* Augmented supported instruction set (almost complete with respecto to [[3]](#ref3)). Including in particular:
  * `DATA` and `RESTORE`. For this, the new named argument `data` is added to the `comp` object, storing the address of the current data to read (`Line-Statement-Element`).
  * `LIST`. Program listings are reconstructed from the internal representation of the program. To reconstruct a `REM` statement, the original remark is kept as an argument of this statement.
  * `ON` `expr` `GOTO`/`GOSUB` ...
* Test suite. Having the file `basic.pl` consulted, the goal `basic:test` starts testing.
* Color themes.
* Bug fixes:
  * `NEXT` test was incorrect. In addition to the comment already at the web page, it only worked for ascending `FOR` indexes.

The `comp` object also includes the named argument `source`, which stores the program source: either a file name or a list of codes for the BASIC program.


#### PLBASIC lacks with respect to Prolog BASIC 0.1

* A low-level binary arithmetic for floating point operations.
  Instead, Prolog floating point arithmetic is used. Results are truncated to conform with the precision of the Seiko Data/UC 2000.


#### PLBASIC deviations from Prolog BASIC 0.1

* Input/Ouput arguments such as `CompIn` and `CompOut` rewritten as `CompIn`-`CompOut` instead of DCG for state passing (DCG led to cumbersome writings with `{}` and troublesomes with accessing the state).
  However, a better approach would be to use ECDG with a customized accumulator, similar to what is used in the lexer.
* Functions.
  PLBASIC benefits from representing a function argument with a logical variable, simplifying the implementation and avoiding placing frames in the heap.
* Array elements are not reset when declaring the array with `DIM`; instead, each element is reset for the first read access.
* Line numbers are not labeled with the type (always `int`).
  Since a label is composed of the line and statement numbers, this saves space and makes it more readable.


#### Comments about the current design

* Given that an implementation for the next line has been developed (which was needed to calculate the jump to a non-existing line number) the next line attached to each program statemente could be omitted.
  However, from a performance point of view, it is better to have it precalculated.


#### States of the interpreter

Upon interpreting a program, several states of the interpreter can be reached.
A transition between these states are performed by the execution of a single program statement or could be performed by an _external_ action, which refers to a procedure out of the interpreting loop such as a key press.
States are the following:

* `run`. Identifies a running program. First, it can be stopped if a `STOP` statement is executed. Second, it can be ended if either the `END` statement or the end of the program has been reached (there are no further statements to execute). And third, it can be erased if the `NEW` statement is reached along execution.
* `stop`. Identifies a stopped program. A stopped execution could be resumed with the the _extenal_ execution of a `CONT` statement. Execution of such statements is not supported yet.
* `end`. Identifies an ended program. This corresponds to finishing the interpreting loop. An ended execution can not be resumed, but _externally_ restarted; for example, pressing the key `r` (for the `RUN` command).
* `new`. Identifies an erased program and variables. This state is immediately followed by the `end` state.

The following state transition diagram summarizes these states and their transitions. Transitions are labelled by either statements or external actions. In this last case, transition arcs are dashed. _`STMT`_ refers to any statement. `CONT` in the dashed arc is a statement which would be issued at the (watch) system prompt. `restart` corresponds to restarting the interpreting loop. The empty set symbol denotes that there is no remaining statement to run.

#### TODO list

* Windows: Compile the DLL containing a call to Windows `kbhit` in order to emulate `$INKEY`.
* Mimic error reporting.
* Emulate the whole system, not only the execution of BASIC programs.
* DCG/EDCG combined with tabling might avoid termination problems with left recursive grammars.
  Might this combo enhance performance?


### 3.2. The Debugger

#### Data structures

The debugger is built around the `comp` object and a new `debug` object, also implemented as a dict.
This dict includes named arguments for the location and size of the different debug panels:

Locations:

* `program_panel_location`
* `screen_panel_location`
* `inspect_panel_location`
* `control_panel_location`

Sizes:

* `program_panel_size`
* `inspect_panel_size`
* `screen_panel_size`
* `control_panel_size`

Locations are represented by a term `lc(Line, Column)` and sizes by `rc(Rows, Columns)`.

Since the program and inspect panels admit scrolling, the display offset is represented in the following named arguments:

* `program_display_offset`
* `inspect_display_offset`

A 0 offset means no scroll, while a positive/negative scroll means how many rows from the origin row the display is scrolled downwards/upwards. 
The reference row of the inspect panel is 0, while the reference row of the program panel is the selected (current) line.
Thus, the inspect panel does not admit a negative offset.
 
There is also another argument holding the panel in focus:

* `in_focus`
  It may take the values `program`, `inspect`, `screen` or `control`.

Initial values for most of these named arguments can be configured in the file `flags.pl`.

Other named arguments for the debug object (which do not admit configurable initial values) are:

* `program_lines`
  The program listing is a series of screen rows so that each program line can span one or more screen rows.
  This named argument maps the start of each program line to the corresponding screen row.
  The program lines are represented as an AVT tree with:
  *  Key  : Statement line number (a label represented by the term Line-Statement).
  *  Value: Number of the row in the listing (base-0).
* `program_listing`
  This named argument stores the program listing as a list of screen rows (each row is implemented with an atom).
* `inspect_vars`
  Ordered set of inspect variable names (each variable is represented with an atom).
* `inspect_listing`
  The inspect listing is the listing of inspect variables together with their values, and it is represented as a list of rows (atoms).
* `breakpoints`
  This named argument stores the ordered set of breakpoints as an ordered list of labels (terms of the form Line-Statement).

#### States of the debugger

Similar to the interpreter, debugging a program includes a loop that traverses several states.
A transition between these states are performed by the execution of a single program statement or by a debugger command.
States shared with the interpreter:

* `run`. This state can also be changed to `stop` when encountering a breakpoint (`bk`) in the current running line.
* `stop`. The commmand `(C)ONT` changes this state to `run`. 
* `end`. Identifies an ended program. An ended execution can not be resumed, but _externally_ restarted.
* `new`. Identifies an erased program and variables. This state is immediately followed by the `end` state.

[//]: # (*`TO BE COMPLETED`)

Other states:

* `init`. This is the initialization state, which is reached after a command `R(E)SET`. Its next state is `stop`, which is unconditionally reached from `init`. 
* `quit`. This state corresponds to quit the system, which is reached after the commmand `(Q)UIT`. 
* `cont`. This state is reached after a command `(C)ONT` or an _external_ continuation command `CONT`. Its next state is `run`, which is unconditionally reached from `cont`. 
* `step`. Identifies an erased program and variables. This state is immediately followed by the `end` state.
  
The following state transition diagram summarizes these states and their transitions. 
Transitions are labelled by either the execution of a statement, or issuing a command or produced by external actions. 
In this last case, transition arcs are dashed. 
_`STMT`_ refers to any statement, and `bk` that a breakpoint has been found for the execution of the current statement.
